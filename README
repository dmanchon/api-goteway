A study on API gateway design
=============================

- Goal: learn a bit of Go by implement a naive API gateway in golang in less than 100LOC
- How to run: `make run`
- How to build: `make build`

- Example interaction:
  Everything after the prefix path will be passed to the target service.
  ```
  $ make run
  $ curl -i "http://localhost:8080/dogs/woof.json"  # this calls the dogs service
  $ curl -i "http://localhost:8080/cats/meow"  # this calls the cats service
  $ curl -i "http://localhost:8080/birds/see/blackbird"  # this fails since there is no config for "/birds" prefix
  ```
